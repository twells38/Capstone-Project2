/*Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer.
When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down,
and the server forgets everything about the user.
Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the user":
When a user visits a web page, his/her name can be stored in a cookie.
Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his/her name.
Cookies are saved in name-value pairs*/
/*
When a browser requests a web page from a server, cookies belonging to the page are added to the request.
This way the server gets the necessary data to "remember" information about users.*/
